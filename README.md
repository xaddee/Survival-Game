# Survival-Game - OOP
A console game, where we have some agents that have to fight eachother.The idea of the game is: one agent moves, if he ends up
in the same spot as other agent, they will fight, one of them will win and then repeat. There are more types of agents and they can also pick up some power up items. The agents are going to pick the best place to move to ( if an item is nearby they will pick the item as the point to move to, if an agent is nearby they will go fight him and if there's nothing they will just pick a random spot). When a smaller number of agents is left they are just going to speed up the game and start picking fighting over anything else. The agents, based on their type can see further, move more blocks at once or they can simply teleport to a specific
location. The items can increase their vision or make them win the next battle for sure or increase the amount of blocks they can moveat once. Last standing agent wins.
